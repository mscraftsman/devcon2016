    <p>
        The MSCC Developers Conference 2016 will offer three days of technical sessions presented by members of our community, as well as passionate developers
        in the field of IT. This is your chance to share how you’ve used modern software technology to design, develop and deploy amazing applications.
        These three tracks will give everyone an opportunity to dive into the latest innovations in software application development.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your proposed talk is approved, you’ll have the opportunity to hang out with developers from leading enterprises in Mauritius and across the world.

    <h3 class="lead">Tips for Successful Proposals</h3>
    <p>
        Help us understand why your presentation is the right one for the conference. Below are some tips for writing a successful proposal. Please keep in mind that this event is by and for professionals. Our participants expect that all presentations and supporting materials will be respectful, inclusive, and adhere to our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity/pages/Code_of_Conduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be authentic. Your peers need original ideas in real-world scenarios, relevant examples, and knowledge transfer.</li>
        <li>Give your proposal a simple and straightforward title. Clever or inappropriate titles make it harder to figure out what you’re really talking about.</li>
        <li>Include as much detail about the presentation as possible. Longer talks should provide more details.</li>
        <li>If you are proposing a panel, tell us who else would be on it.</li>
        <li>Keep proposals free of marketing and sales.</li>
        <li>If you are not the speaker, provide the contact information of the person you’re suggesting. We tend to ignore proposals submitted by PR agencies unless we can reach the suggested participant directly. Improve the proposal’s chances of being accepted by working closely with the presenter(s) to write a jargon-free proposal that contains clear value for attendees.</li>
        <li>Keep the audience in mind: they’re professional, and already pretty smart.</li>
        <li>Context is important. If your talk is about something truly ground-breaking, it’ll be helpful if you describe it in terms of things that attendees might already know of.</li>
        <li>Limit the scope: in 45 to 60 minutes, you won’t be able to cover Everything about Framework X. Instead, pick a useful aspect, or a particular technique, or walk through a simple program.</li>
        <li>Explain why people will want to attend: is your topic gaining traction? Is it critical to business? Will attendees learn how to use it, program it, or just what it is?</li>
        <li>Repeated talks from the conference circuit are less likely to be appealing. If you speak at a lot of events, be sure to note why this presentation is different.</li>
        <li>Don’t assume that your company’s name buys you credibility. If you’re talking about something important that you have specific knowledge of because of what your company does, spell that out in the description.</li>
        <li>Indicate in your proposal notes whether you can give all the talks you submitted.</li>
        <li>Does your presentation have the participation of a woman, person of color, or member of another group often underrepresented at tech conferences? Diversity is one of the factors we seriously consider when reviewing proposals as we seek to broaden our speaker roster.</li>
        <li>We welcome sessions for attendees with a variety of skill levels. Indicate the experience and knowledge level of the audience that you are targeting: novice, intermediate, or expert.</li>
    </ul>
